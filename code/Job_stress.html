    <h1>Job Stress</h1>
    <p>
        Stress is the body’s response to physical and mental demands. Stress in general is defined as “a physical, chemical, or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and may be a factor in disease causation.”<br>
        One type of stress is job stress. With job stress, the stressors involved are work-related. Job stress is a type of stress and is caused by conditions in the workplace that negatively affect an individual’s performance and/or overall well-being of his body and mind.<br>
        Work-related stress is the result of a conflict between the role and needs of an individual employee and the demands of the workplace. Research has shown that feeling stressed at work is not confined to particular occupations or levels within organizations. Workers with management responsibilities also show stress symptoms. Different individuals may react differently to stress and the same person may react differently to stress at different times.
