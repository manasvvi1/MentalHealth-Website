    <h1>Bipolar Disorder</h1>
    <p>Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a mental illness that brings severe high and low moods and changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior.<br>
        People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. In between those periods, they usually feel normal. You can think of the highs and the lows as two "poles" of mood, which is why it's called "bipolar" disorder.
        </p>
        <h2>Bipolar disorder symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            There are three main symptoms that can occur with bipolar disorder: mania, hypomania, and depression.<br>
            While experiencing mania, a person with bipolar disorder may feel an emotional high.
             They can feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full of energy. During manic episodes, they may also engage in behavior such as:
<ul>
	<li>spending sprees</li>
    <li>	unprotected sex</li>
        <li>drug use</li>
        </ul>
Hypomania is generally associated with bipolar II disorder. It’s similar to mania, but it’s not as severe. Unlike mania, hypomania may not result in any trouble at work, school, or in social relationships. However, people with hypomania still notice changes in their mood.<br>
During an episode of depression you may experience:
<ul>	
<li>deep sadness</li>
    <li>	hopelessness</li>
        <li>	loss of energy</li>
            <li>	lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed</li>
                <li>	periods of too little or too much sleep</li>
                    <li>suicidal thoughts</li>
</ul>
Although it’s not a rare condition, bipolar disorder can be hard to diagnose because of its varied symptoms. Find out about the symptoms that often occur during high and low periods.
</p>
<h2>Bipolar disorder symptoms in women</h2>
<p>
    Men and women are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in equal numbers. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may be different between the two genders. In many cases, a woman with bipolar disorder may:
	<ul>
  <li>  be diagnosed later in life, in her 20s or 30s</li>
    <li> have milder episodes of mania</li>
        <li> experience more depressive episodes than manic episodes</li>
            <li>   have four or more episodes of mania and depression in a year, which is called rapid cycling</li>
                <li> experience other conditions at the same time, including thyroid disease, obesity, anxiety disorders, and migraines</li>
                    <li> have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder</li>
</ul>
Women with bipolar disorder may also relapse more often. This is believed to be caused by hormonal changes related to menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause. If you’re a woman and think you may have bipolar disorder, it’s important for you to get the facts. Here’s what you need to know about bipolar disorder in women.
</p>
      <h2>Bipolar disorder symptoms in men</h2>
      <p>
        Men and women both experience common symptoms of bipolar disorder. However, men may experience symptoms differently than women. Men with bipolar disorder may:
        <ul>	
        <li>be diagnosed earlier in life</li>
        	<li>experience more severe episodes, especially manic episodes</li>
        	<li>have substance abuse issues</li>
        	<li>act out during manic episodes</li>
        </ul>
        Men with bipolar disorder are less likely than women to seek medical care on their own. They’re also more likely to die by suicide.

      <h2>Types of bipolar disorder</h2>
      <p>There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.</p>
      <h2>Bipolar I</h2>
      <p>Bipolar I is defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic or major depressive episodes before and after the manic episode. This type of bipolar disorder affects men and women equally</p>
      <h2>Bipolar II</h2>
      <p>
        People with this type of bipolar disorder experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least two weeks. They also have at least one hypomanic episode that lasts about four days. This type of bipolar disorder is thought to be more common in women.
      </p>
      <h2>Cyclothymia</h2>
      <p>People with cyclothymia have episodes of hypomania and depression. These symptoms are shorter and less severe than the mania and depression caused by bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition only experience a month or two at a time where their moods are stable.
    </p>
    <h2>Bipolar disorder and depression</h2>
    <p>
        Bipolar disorder can have two extremes: up and down. To be diagnosed with bipolar, you must experience a period of mania or hypomania. People generally feel “up” in this phase of the disorder. When you’re experiencing an “up” change in mood, you may feel highly energized and be easily excitable.<br>
        Some people with bipolar disorder will also experience a major depressive episode, or a “down” mood. When you’re experiencing a “down” change in mood, you may feel lethargic, unmotivated, and sad. However, not all people with bipolar disorder who have this symptom feel “down” enough to be labeled depressed. For instance, for some people, once their mania is treated, a normal mood may feel like depression because they enjoyed the “high” caused by the manic episode.<br>
        While bipolar disorder can cause you to feel depressed, it’s not the same as the condition called depression. Bipolar disorder can cause highs and lows, but depression causes moods and emotions that are always “down.” Discover the differences between bipolar disorder and depression.
