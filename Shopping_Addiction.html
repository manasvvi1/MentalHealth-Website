<p>A shopping addict is someone who shops compulsively and who may feel like they have no control over their behavior.</p>

<h2>Emotional Symptoms of a Shopping Addiction</h2>
<p>Like all addicts, shopping addicts may try to hide their addiction, and if a loved one is addicted to shopping, they may try to hide it from you. If you hide credit card bills, shopping bags or receipts, you may be a shopaholic. In some cases, shopaholics may try to hide their addiction by lying about just one element of it. For instance, a person may admit they went shopping, but they may lie about how much they spent.</p>
<p>Some of the other emotional symptoms you may notice from a shopaholic include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spending more than they can afford</li>
	<li>Shopping as a reaction to feeling angry or depressed</li>
	<li>Shopping as a way to feel less guilty about a previous shopping spree</li>
	<li>Harming relationships due to spending or shopping too much</li>
	<li>Losing control of the shopping behavior</li>
</ul>
