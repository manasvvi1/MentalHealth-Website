# MentalHealth

### IDEA ###
Mental health is an integral part of health. Our mental well-being dictates our thinking, outlook and response to the outside world. Even so, there is a terrible stigma against the people facing it. So many people still believe that a person can just “snap out of it”. Through our project, we would like to bring forward the seriousness of the issue and help out the people who are suffering from the same.

### AIM ###
* Our motive is to help people realize that no one is perfect and to help them accept their imperfections.
* We believe that in situations of stress, a conversation where the person can put their heart out works much better than what loads of tablets can do.

### ABOUT THE PROJECT ###
Our site gives information about mental disorders and the concept of law of attraction. They can also know about others experiences at the same place. People can take self-quiz and know about their mental health by answering a simple set of questions. Not only this, but people can make their own diary, where they can write their heart out. The best part of the diary is that the notes written aren’t saved, so no one will ever know what was actually written, making it more comfortable for people to write.


Even a small initiative by us might bring a big change in the society.
