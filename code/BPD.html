    <h1>Borderline Personality Disorder</h1>
    <p>Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
    Borderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, how you relate to others and how you behave.
Signs and symptoms may include:
<ul>	
<li>An intense fear of abandonment, even going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection</li>
    <li>A pattern of unstable intense relationships, such as idealizing someone one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel</li>
        <li>	Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image that include shifting goals and values, and seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist at all</li>
            <li>	Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours</li>
                <li>Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, reckless driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating or drug abuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship</li>
                    <li>Suicidal threats or behavior or self-injury, often in response to fear of separation or rejection</li>
                        <li>	Wide mood swings lasting from a few hours to a few days, which can include intense happiness, irritability, shame or anxiety</li>
                            <li>Ongoing feelings of emptiness</li>
                                <li>Inappropriate, intense anger, such as frequently losing your temper, being sarcastic or bitter, or having physical fights</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatments</h2>
<p>In most cases, BPD is treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy. However, there are times when a person with BPD may be hospitalized to protect themselves and others. There are several evidence based psychotherapies often used in the treatment of BPD including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT), and Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP).<br>
